# YouTube playlist MP3 converter<br>that can shazam, tag and also play songs

**PYPL2MP3** is a Python program that one-shot downloads audio from 
**entire YouTube playlists** and saves the tracks in MP3 format with 
shazam-confirmed ID3 tags and proper cover art. It also allows you to 
play imported MP3s, search for songs across all imported playlists, 
manage metadata, and much more.

The program runs from the command line and is designed for a clean and 
user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Import YouTube playlist songs in MP3 format  
- Automatically shazam songs to set accurate ID3 tags and cover art  
- Consistently name MP3 files by artist and song title
- Fix metadata to shazam-unmatched "junk" songs
- Cleanup existing metadata from imported songs
- List songs and playlists with detailed information  
- Easily play songs directly from the CLI and open related videos
- Filter and sort songs via fuzzy search (available for all commands)  

---

## Limitations

- Only public playlists can be imported  
- Region-restricted videos are excluded from import 
- Import of age-restricted videos fails but do not block others  

---

## Requirements

PYPL2MP3 requires:

- Python ≥ 3.7  

### Dependency Manager

- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is required to manage dependencies 
  and run the program in its own virtual env.

### Audio Tools

- [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and `ffprobe` (shipped together) must be 
  installed for audio conversion and tagging.

### Proof of Origin Token

- A Proof of Origin Token (POT) is needed to access YouTube audio / video streams 
  ([details here](https://pytubefix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/po_token.html)).  
- It is automatically generated via **BotGuard** from `pytubefix` version `8.12` 
  and requires [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to be installed.  

---

## Installation

```sh
uv sync
```

---

## Configuration

PYPL2MP3 works out of the box, storing imported playlists in `~/pypl2mp3` 
by default. It does not require any database.

### Optional Environment Variables

- **`PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_PATH`** 
  – Folder path for storing imported MP3 playlists 
- **`PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_PLAYLIST_ID`** 
  – Favorite YouTube playlist ID for quick access

Example setup (in terminal):
```sh
export PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_PATH="/your/custom/path"
export PYPL2MP3_DEFAULT_PLAYLIST_ID="yourFavoritePlaylistID"
```

To persist settings, add these to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

---

## Execution

From the project root, run:
```sh
uv run pypl2mp3 <command> [options]
```

Or use the shell wrapper from any directory:
```sh
sh /path/to/pypl2mp3.sh <command> [options]
```

---

## Usage

- Run a command:  
  ```sh
  pypl2mp3 <command> [options]
  ```

- List available commands:  
  ```sh
  pypl2mp3 --help
  ```

- Get help for a specific command:  
  ```sh
  pypl2mp3 <command> --help
  ```

---

## Commands

**Note:** 
In the command uses described below, the term "INDEX" refers to the rank of an 
item in a list of songs or playlists resulting from the applied filter criteria; 
it therefore only has meaning at the time of command execution.


### Global Options
- `-h, --help`: 
  Show command-specific help  
- `-r, --repo <path>`: 
  Set playlist repository (default: see [Configuration](#configuration))  
- `-d, --debug`: 
  Enable **verbose errors (*)** and logging to file `<project_root>/log/pypl2mp3.log`
- `-D, --deep`:
  Enable deep debug with fully detailed stack trace in log file

**(*) Verbose errors** display a shortened version of the stack trace:
```
[ERROR] Failed to import song "LANA DEL REY - COLA (OFFICIAL AUDIO)"
        [2] pypl2mp3.libs.song.SongModelException: Failed to stream audio track for YouTube video "UtVUkZ4Rx_I"

## Examples

**Import / sync a YouTube playlist with accurate Shazam recognition**
```sh

```

**Permissively retrieve Jimi Hendrix songs from all imported playlists**

## Troubleshooting

Recent changes to the YouTube API may prevent songs from being uploaded or 
tagged. You can try updating `pytubefix` to its latest minor version as a 
temporary workaround while you wait for a fix (also, feel free to file an 
issue):
```sh
uv lock --upgrade-package pytubefix
```

## Thanks

PYPL2MP3 relies primarily on [`pytubefix`](https://github.com/JuanBindez/pytubefix) 
and [`shazamio`](https://github.com/shazamio/ShazamIO) under the hood to provide 
its core features. These packages work fine and are well maintained. They 
also require a lot of effort to sync with the services they provide access to. 
So, if you like PYPL2MP3, please give them a&nbsp;★ on GitHub.
