    Normalize match scores and apply threshold filtering.

    Implements score normalization algorithm:
    1. Orders matches by raw score to preserve ranking
    2. Calculates score range and minimum
    3. Applies square root normalization to compress range:
       normalized = √(raw - min) / √(range) * 100
    4. Filters by normalized threshold
    
    Args:
        matched_songs (list[dict[str, Path | float]]): Songs with raw scores.
            Each dict must have 'path' and 'match_level' keys.
        threshold (float): Minimum normalized score (0-100) to retain

    Returns:
        list[Path] | None: Filtered and sorted song paths, or None if no matches
        
    Note:
        The square root normalization helps emphasize relative differences
        between closely matched songs while compressing larger gaps.
